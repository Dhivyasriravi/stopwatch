This interactive stopwatch webpage is a simple online timer that you can use right in your web browser. It lets you measure how much time has passed with clear start, stop, and reset buttons.

When you open the page, you will see a big digital display showing hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. You just click Start to begin counting time. If you click Stop, it pauses the timer so you can take a break or check your progress. The Reset button clears everything back to zero so you can start over.

The stopwatch is made with HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling and layout, and JavaScript to make it work. JavaScript handles the counting and updating of the time every fraction of a second, so you see it changing live.

The design is clean and easy to read, with big numbers and clear buttons. It also works well on different devices, like computers, tablets, and mobile phones. If you resize the window or use it on your phone, it still looks good and is easy to use.

This webpage doesn’t need any downloads or extra software—just open it in your browser, and it works right away.
